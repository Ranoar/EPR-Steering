README

The optimalprojectors.nb file is a mathematica file which takes input density matrices and outputs a set of Pauli Matrix combinations for determining the projectors for use in the matlab file steerableweightoptproj.m

The other two files are matlab editor files which can be used alongside the package cvx http://cvxr.com/cvx/ to calculated the EPR steering for two computable measures of it.
Make sure cvx is unpacked and that the filename loaded is something.mat, it should be a list of 4x4 matrices.

Unfortunately the convex optimisation proceedure is not so easily computable. Most computers are limited to looking at 5000 sets of desnity matrices within a reasonable timeframe

Good luck!
