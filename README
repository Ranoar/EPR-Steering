README

The following two files are matlab editor files which can be used alongside the package cvx http://cvxr.com/cvx/ to calculated the EPR steering for two computable measures of it.
Make sure cvx is unpacked and that the filename loaded is something.mat, it should be a list of 4x4 matrices.

Unfortunately the convex optimisation proceedure is not so easily computable. Most computers are limited to looking at 5000 sets of desnity matrices within a reasonable timeframe

Good luck!
